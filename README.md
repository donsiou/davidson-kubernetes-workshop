# Davidson Kubernetes WORKSHOP : The basics of Kubernetes and how to deploy your application in Dataplatform clusters

## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate the basic concepts of Kubernetes, as covered in our Kubernetes training.

To achieve this objective, we will deploy the following application: kubernetes-formation-app. This application has been specifically designed for this training and is a web application developed with Flask. It presents a series of tasks related to Kubernetes (creating and configuring objects: Pod, Service). Each time a task is completed, a new one appears.

Initially, we will deploy this application and expose it with a DNS. Then, we will follow the tasks it prompts us to complete.

In case of any obstacles, this GitHub repository contains solutions for each step.
